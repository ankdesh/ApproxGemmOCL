# ApproxGemmOCL
Code for optimizing GEMM operation by trading for accuracy on GPU using OpenCL.

# Building -
To build the simple matrix multiplication with g++, use following command
$ g++ -I<Path to CL include folder> simpleMatMul.cpp -lOpenCL -o simpleMatMul

# Note - 
This project is still in nascent state. Keep tuned for interesting work
